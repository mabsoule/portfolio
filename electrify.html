    <h1 class="section" id="problem">Problem</h1>
    <p class="text">When beginning this project, the automotive scene looked very different than it does today. In terms of mass produced electric vehicles, the low to mid budget customer had a severe shortage of affordable zero emission vehicle options.</p>

    <h1 class="section" id="approach">Approach</h1>
    <p class="text">Without many commercial options, I landed on the idea of converting a combustion powered vehicle into an all-electric. My decision was based on three benefits tied to this solution:</p>

    <p class="text">Converting a vehicle requires an excellent understanding of how each vehicle system works. Don’t get me wrong, I drooled over car magazines growing up but I had no idea how they worked when it came down to the fine details. Nearly the first quarter of the project was spent developing a solid foundation of knowledge.</p>

    <p class="text">I put an emphasis on selecting a car that was small and light to reduce the size and power (and thus price) of the drivetrain components needed to achieve the performance goals outlined. In the realm of smaller cars, I narrowed in on the latest generation Toyota Celica. Despite being quite small, Celica’s have 4 seats, a large trunk and engine bay to distribute the battery pack's weight, and are built in a simple and reliable way.</p>

    <h1 class="section" id="teardown">Donor vehicle teardown</h1>
    <p class="text">I had a base car to work off of, now what? To make room for the new electric drivetrain I removed the stock Toyota ZZ1 engine, ECU (engine control unit), radiators, exhaust, and fuel system. Unfortunately, that’s a little more complicated then it sounds. Combustion engines typically provide power through a serpentine belt to a number of different systems such as your vehicle's power brakes, power steering, and cabin heating system. Each disrupted system was then dismantled, analyzed and taken on as a separate design challenge.</p>

    <p class="text">An AC motor was selected to allow for regenerative braking. By comparative analysis with the stock Toyota ZZ1 engines specs, the HPEV AC50 running at 96v and 650amps was a great candidate to achieve all the outlined project performance goals.</p>

    <h1 class="section" id="powertrainInstallation">Powertrain installation</h1>
    <p class="text">After removing the stock Toyota parts, I rebuilt the powertrain using an HPEV AC50 electric motor directly mounted to the stock transmission. I selected a manual transmission vehicle to simplify this conversion process. While there was a lot of flexibility in where certain components could go,  the motor was not one of them. Positioning it early allowed other systems designs to be planned out around the motor's dimensions.</p>

An upgraded stage 1 clutch was installed to better handle the instantaneous torque delivered from the new electric motor. With the clutch binding the motor shaft to the transmission and the axles linking the transmission to the wheels, the powertrain had a complete mechanical linkage.</p>

In order to keep all other electrical components in the engine bay, a maximum of 12 cells and a regular 12v battery were fitted into the front in a fabricated steel battery box. The remaining 20 cells were placed behind the back seat in their own separate fabricated box.</p>

Based on the power needed by the HPEV AC50 motor, the Curtis 1238 motor controller was a great candidate for achieving the vehicle performance goals outlined earlier. A heat sink was installed for air cooling and the controller was installed.</p>

    <p class="text">Much like the brake vacuum pump, the original water pump was powered by the combustion engine. To convert the power steering system, an electric hydraulic pump and fluid reservior were added back into the power steering system. Power was routed from the control box with a fuse and contactor built into the system so it would be activated by turning the ignition key. Due to the high power consumption of this system, an additional control switch was added in the cabin to turn off power steering in emergency situations.</p>

A fan blowing air through the grid of fins carried the heat into the cabin. Without any liquid cooled components to provide heat, I removed the coolant loop and replaced fins with an electric heater. Power was wired from the control box such that the system would be limited to only operating when the vehicle ignition is on and the fan system is running. A safety override switch was installed to turn off the heating system in an emergency situation.</p>

    <h1 id="limitations" class="section">Limitations</h1>
    <p class="text">Did I build a legitimate competitor to current all-electric production vehicles? No, this vehicle is far from production quality. Due to the sheer workload required to complete this project, I was unable to work through enough iterations on my designs, master the trades required to produce ultra aesthetic components, and spend the necessary time on each design challenge to nail the craftsmanship of this product. Overall, the focus of this project was placed on functionality over the aesthetic properties to ensure a working product was reached within the budget constraints.</p>

    <h1 id="learnings" class="section">Learnings</h1>
    <p class="text">In terms of technical knowledge, this project pushed me to learn an incredible amount about vehicles and electromechanical design. However, looking back on my experience, it was not the technical knowledge that I appreciate most. I credit this project with teaching me how to deal with ambiguity, decompose overwhelming tasks, and remain persistent and dedicated regardless of where I start in my understanding. Since completing this project, I have focused on continuing to develop a well-rounded design mindset and a diverse toolbox of techniques to bring to new challenges.</p>

    <h1 id="acknowledgments" class="section">Acknowledgments</h1>
    <p class="text">I’d like to thank Ryan Smith, Elle Nichols, and Greg Soule for their countless hours of help laboring on the car to ultimately make this project a success. I’d also like to thank Greg Soule and Karen Braun for trusting me with a large financial investment to make this project come to a reality. I wouldn’t be who I am today without this incredible experience.</p>

  <section class="spacing">
    <h1 id="nextUp" class="section">Future interests</h1>
    <p class="text">Looking forwards, I would like to have the opportunity to apply my product design skills back into the transportation design space. Whether it be through an extension of this project, or through future internships, I would like to use a user-centered design mindset to create better transportation experiences in our modern world. This project gave me an excellent mental model of what we currently see as a traditional transportation method, driving and riding in vehicles. Now I want to push the envelope and create future methods of transportation and focus my efforts on nailing each aspect of the customer's journey. Not just creating something functional, creating something delightful and influential in the eyes of the user. <br><br> Have a challenge you think I’d be interested in? Get in touch!</p>
